## Research Question

Based off the Boston Dataset, can we use machine learning to predict the value of a given house?

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

opportunity (what data do we have)
challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
why you chose this method


### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

At least 1 figure
At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
suggested next step that could make it better.
