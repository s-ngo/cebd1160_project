## Research Question

Based off the Boston Dataset, can we use machine learning to predict the value of a given house?

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

opportunity (what data do we have)
challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. (https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-boston-home-prices/)

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:
pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
why you chose this method

I chose Mean Squared Error as the most appropriate performance metric for predicting housing prices because we are predicting a numeric value (a regression problem)


### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

At least 1 figure
At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
suggested next step that could make it better.
